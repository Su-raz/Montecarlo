**Function Definitions:**
**create_markov_chain:** Builds a Markov chain model based on a list of names.
**select_character:** Selects characters based on their frequencies in the Markov chain.
**generate_word:** Generates a word using the Markov chain model.
**contains_zangy_letters:** Checks if a word contains specific letters.
**generate_names:** Generates names that satisfy certain criteria.
**Code Logic:**
The create_markov_chain function processes a list of names, creates a Markov chain model, and counts the occurrences of characters and transitions between characters.
The select_character function picks characters based on their frequencies in the Markov chain.
The generate_word function generates a word using the Markov chain model.
The contains_zangy_letters function checks if a word contains certain letters.
The generate_names function uses the Markov chain model to generate names that meet specific length and character criteria.
